        "content": "1. Yes, you’re using numbers selectively to shape a narrative. By focusing on “68% of USL” without providing the broader context (that it represents about 90% of the protocol’s total revenue), you create the impression that the redistribution is lower or insufficient. This is misleading. Cherry-picking numbers without context is classic manipulation; as the saying goes, “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.”\n\n2. The revenue-switch redistributes up to 100% of the protocol's revenue. All of the communications, afaik and at least not >2 months ones, are very clear on this aspect. This is also because it is obvious that a protocol can't survive by giving absolutely all of its revenue. It has to build its own Treasury and cashflow. So, currently, you are getting around 92% of the total revenue, pending a clear and structured framework, that is being worked on. There's worse situation. As a reminder, it is the highest rev-switch in the whole DeFi ecosystem.\n\n3. On top of this, the USL revenue is not actually realized. This means that the protocol, being so mean and so unfair as it is, is actually using its own Treasury to artificially redistribute the majority of the USL revenue, when in fact, this revenue isn't even realized, as it is only realized at repayment or liquidation of the loans. So, technically speaking, you argument of \"100% of the realized revenue\" isn't even true. Yes, there could be solution to \"pre-realize\" the USL revenue or redistribute it in better ways (including ideas you yourself proposed). This is exactly why a structure framework is being worked on. But in the meantime, pending this framework, it is kind and very fair to artificially realize that revenue to redistribute it. It would make sense for the protocol to limit this to actual realized revenue in the meantime, pending the framework, and redistribute less than half of what it is currently redistributing. The current situation is very good, knowing that on top of that, it is temporary.\n\n4. Once I said all of this, it's unproductive. Once I clarified that a framework addressing this is in the works, and that until then you're currently getting >90% of the total revenue, it's absolutely useless and unproductive to say \"well we should be getting even more in the meantime\" or \"it should be faster\" or \"it should've been done before\" or whatever. It's useless. It's actually even worse, since you're now creating the FUD/situation you're afraid of, and you do it very well since you even go back on the Early Redemption fees situation to create fear of something like that happening again and so on. It's unproductive and useless to do what you're doing. The only thing you'll get, is me switching to corporate answers or simply ignoring your remarks, as anyways, I've said something is in the works, and keeping criticizing or whatever won't change a thing."
